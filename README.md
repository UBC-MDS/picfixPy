#### Project Overview:

PicFix will allows you to quickly touch-up images in an IDE (i.e. Jupyter notebook, rstudio) without powering up a full-scale image processing software(i.e. ADOBE, MS). Be able to quickly apply contrast, vibrance, and a smart sharpen to photos quickly and swiftly! Simple to use, no fuss, we can simply use the following functions. Full blown photo editing libraries and softwares can be heavy weight, we just want to quickly touch up and fix up an image in the IDE without exiting the IDE.

#### Functions:

###### sharpen
Given an image, increase the weight of the edges, (via convolution), returns an image.

###### contrast
Given an image, make dark pixels much darker, and bright pixels slightly darker, returns an image.

###### vibrance
Given an image, increase the overall intensity and saturation by increasing more for colours that were less saturated to begin with, returns an image.

How this project fit into the Python and R ecosystems

#### Python ecosystem

- scikit-image, 

R ecosystem

- magick package in R offers an overwhelming amount of functionality, we want to offer a light-weight, extremely easy to use alternative to the magick package in R, allow users to quickly touch up and enhance their images without defaulting to these cumbersome library.
